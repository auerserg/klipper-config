[tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: P1.17
#   The pin connected to the TMC2208 PDN_UART line. This parameter
#   must be provided.
tx_pin: P4.29
#   If using separate receive and transmit lines to communicate with
#   the driver then set uart_pin to the receive pin and tx_pin to the
#   transmit pin. The default is to use uart_pin for both reading and
#   writing.
#select_pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins to set prior to accessing the
#   tmc2208 UART. This may be useful for configuring an analog mux for
#   UART communication. The default is to not configure any pins.
interpolate: False
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). This interpolation does
#   introduce a small systemic positional deviation - see
#   TMC_Drivers.md for details. The default is True.
run_current: 0.8
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
#hold_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. Setting a hold_current is not
#   recommended (see TMC_Drivers.md for details). The default is to
#   not reduce the current.
#sense_resistor: 0.110
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.110 ohms.
stealthchop_threshold: 0
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.
#uart_address:
#   The address of the TMC2209 chip for UART messages (an integer
#   between 0 and 3). This is typically used when multiple TMC2209
#   chips are connected to the same UART pin. The default is zero.

#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC2209
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
#diag_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to the DIAG line of the TMC2209
#   chip. The pin is normally prefaced with "^" to enable a pullup.
#   Setting this creates a "tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual
#   pin which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this
#   enables "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGTHRS to
#   an appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
