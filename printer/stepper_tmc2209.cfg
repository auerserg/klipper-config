# For TMC2209 UART
#   1) Remove all of the jumpers below the stepper drivers
#   2) Place jumpers on the red pin headers labeled XUART (XUART, YUART etc.)

#   See the "tmc2208" section for the definition of these parameters.
#uart_address:

#diag_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to the DIAG line of the TMC2209
#   chip. The pin is normally prefaced with "^" to enable a pullup.
#   Setting this creates a "tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual
#   pin which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this
#   enables "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGTHRS to
#   an appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
