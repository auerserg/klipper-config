[extruder]
step_pin: P2.13
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin: P0.11
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin: !P2.12
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance: 7.735
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.
microsteps: 16
#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
nozzle_diameter: 0.4
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.
filament_diameter: 1.75
#   The nominal diameter of the raw filament (in mm) as it enters the
#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section: 1.92
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#instantaneous_corner_velocity: 1.000
#   The maximum instantaneous velocity change (in mm/s) of the
#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
max_extrude_only_distance: 150
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not have any impact on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040
#   A time range (in seconds) to use when calculating the average
#   extruder velocity for pressure advance. A larger value results in
#   smoother extruder movements. This parameter may not exceed 200ms.
#   This setting only applies if pressure_advance is non-zero. The
#   default is 0.040 (40 milliseconds).
#
# The remaining variables describe the extruder heater.
heater_pin: P2.7
#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.
sensor_type: ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G", "Generic

#   "Temperature sensors" section for other sensors. This parameter
#   must be provided.
sensor_pin: P0.24
#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pullup_resistor: 4700
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the pullup attached to the thermistor.
#   This parameter is only valid when the sensor is a thermistor. The
#   default is 4700 ohms.
#smooth_time: 1.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 1 seconds.
control: pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pid_Kp: 26.416
pid_Ki: 1.420
pid_Kd: 122.834
#   The proportional (pid_Kp), integral (pid_Ki), and derivative
#   (pid_Kd) settings for the PID feedback control system. Klipper
#   evaluates the PID settings with the following general formula:
#     heater_pwm = (Kp*error + Ki*integral(error) - Kd*derivative(error)) / 255
#   Where "error" is "requested_temperature - measured_temperature"
#   and "heater_pwm" is the requested heating rate with 0.0 being full
#   off and 1.0 being full on. Consider using the PID_CALIBRATE
#   command to obtain these parameters. The pid_Kp, pid_Ki, and pid_Kd
#   parameters must be provided for PID heaters.
#max_delta: 2.0
#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
min_extrude_temp: 200
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 300
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.
