[mcu]
serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ.
#   This parameter must be provided when using a serial port.
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
#canbus_uuid:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the unique
#   chip identifier to connect to. This value must be provided when using
#   CAN bus for communication.
#canbus_interface:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the CAN
#   network interface to use. The default is 'can0'.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'cheetah', 'rpi_usb',
#   and 'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on
#   Arduino boards and clones. The 'cheetah' method is a special
#   method needed for some Fysetc Cheetah boards. The 'rpi_usb' method
#   is useful on Raspberry Pi boards with micro-controllers powered
#   over USB - it briefly disables power to all USB ports to
#   accomplish a micro-controller reset. The 'command' method involves
#   sending a Klipper command to the micro-controller so that it can
#   reset itself. The default is 'arduino' if the micro-controller
#   communicates over a serial port, 'command' otherwise.



[printer]
kinematics:
#   The type of printer in use. This option may be one of: cartesian,
#   corexy, corexz, hybrid_corexy, hybrid_corexz, rotary_delta, delta,
#   deltesian, polar, winch, or none. This parameter must be specified.
max_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This value may be changed at runtime using the
#   SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). Although this parameter is described as a "maximum"
#   acceleration, in practice most moves that accelerate or decelerate
#   will do so at the rate specified here. The value specified here
#   may be changed at runtime using the SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command.
#   This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The value specified here may
#   be changed at runtime using the SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. The
#   default is half of max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The value specified here may be
#   changed at runtime using the SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. The
#   default is 5mm/s.
