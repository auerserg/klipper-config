[virtual_sdcard]
path:
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
#   be provided.
#on_error_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when an error is reported.

[sdcard_loop]

[force_move]
#enable_force_move: False
#   Set to true to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION
#   extended G-Code commands. The default is false.

[pause_resume]
#recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s). Default is 50.0 mm/s.

[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
#retract_speed: 20
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
#unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

[gcode_arcs]
#resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a
#   finer arc, but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than
#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.

[respond]
#default_type: echo
#   Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one
#   of the following:
#       echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#       command: "// "
#       error: "!! "
#default_prefix: echo:
#   Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will
#   override the "default_type".
